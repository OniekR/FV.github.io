Title: Style and improve Reynolds calculations for accuracy and clarity

Description:
Improve the Reynolds calculation UI and explanatory text to clearly document what is being approximated (e.g., Bingham plastic simplifications), include units, and add tooltips or inline help for PV/YP/AV definitions.

Acceptance criteria:
- All displayed numeric values include units and consistent formatting.
- Add short help text or tooltips for PV, YP, AV and the approximations used for Reynolds calculation.
- Provide a validation section or test vectors (example inputs -> expected Re values) to verify accuracy.
- Improve visual hierarchy of step-by-step calculations (titles, separators, emphasized results) for readability.

Notes:
- Consider adding a small ‘Method’ collapsible panel that explains formulae for advanced users.
